This is a comprehensive Next.js boilerplate that provides a solid foundation for
starting your web development projects. It includes essential configurations,
tools, and libraries to streamline the development process.

  rapidly building custom designs.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - A performant and flexible
  library for building forms.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - A TypeScript-first schema validation library.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) - A pluggable and configurable
  linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) - An opinionated code formatter.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) - A tool that makes it easy to use
  githooks as if they are npm scripts.
- [React-use](https://streamich.github.io/react-use/) - A collection of
  essential hooks for React.
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx#readme) - A tiny utility for
  constructing className strings conditionally.
